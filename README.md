# Decimal Binary Converter

In this project, we have to number input fields. The first field is for the user to enter the decimal value, and the second is for binary input. When the user enters a value in the decimal field the converted binary value is displayed in the binary field. Similarly, when the user inputs in the binary field the corresponding converted value is output in the decimal field.
